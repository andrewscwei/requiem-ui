## Disclaimer

Requiem is an on-going pet project for experimenting with web UI building techniques. It is a stand-alone front-end framework that, at its current state, is not production ready, has an ever-changing API, and lacks proper documentation. Its features are driven by internal requirements and is meant for internal use only.
